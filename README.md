Sky Sync: Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Hilt, and More

Sky Sync is an Android weather app that embodies modern Android development practices, featuring a robust tech stack that includes Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Room, Retrofit, and Hilt. The app's architecture follows the MVVM pattern, showcasing clear and maintainable code organization.

Key Technologies:

Kotlin & Jetpack Compose:
Leveraging the power of Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, Sky Sync offers a clean and concise codebase for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.

Dependency Injection with Hilt:
Hilt is employed for efficient and maintainable dependency injection, streamlining the management of app components and services.

API Integration using Retrofit:
The app seamlessly integrates with the WeatherAPI using Retrofit, demonstrating a robust and structured approach to making API requests and handling responses.

Data Persistence with Room:
Room is utilized for storing and managing user preferences, such as favorite cities and temperature units, providing a reliable and persistent data layer.

Jetpack Navigation:
The app employs Jetpack Navigation for smooth and structured navigation between different screens, ensuring a seamless user experience.

Asynchronous Operations with Coroutines and Kotlin Flows:
Kotlin coroutines and flows are used to handle asynchronous operations efficiently, ensuring that UI interactions remain responsive and smooth.

Code Structure:

UI Components with Compose:
Explore the implementation of UI components using Jetpack Compose, with a focus on creating a visually appealing and user-friendly interface inspired by Cátia Abreu's Behance design.

Dynamic Backgrounds and Weather Conditions:
Understand how the app dynamically changes background images and weather condition icons based on current weather conditions, enhancing the visual experience for users.

City Search, Favorites, and Temperature Unit Customization:
Delve into the code that enables users to search for cities, manage favorites, and customize temperature units, providing a personalized and flexible weather app.

Efficient Navigation with Jetpack Navigation:
Explore the usage of Jetpack Navigation for efficient screen navigation, ensuring a logical flow within the app.

Data Handling and Storage with Room:
Examine the implementation of Room for storing and retrieving user preferences, offering a seamless experience across app sessions.

Asynchronous Operations and Responsiveness:
Dive into the code that utilizes coroutines and flows to handle asynchronous tasks, maintaining app responsiveness during data fetching and updates.
